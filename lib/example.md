We design houses, alterations & additions & small public buildings.
Retallack Thompson are Sydney-based architects seeking to create timeless and enduring architecture, interior and landscape design. We remain optimists, and believe that there is potential beauty in all spaces. We look to make the smallest of manoeuvres, that render the greatest effect, and understand spaces are formed by our relationships with each other, landscape and the world beyond. Our approach to sustainability is to create buildings people love.

Directors Jemima Retallack and Mitchell Thompson have worked in award-winning offices in both Sydney and Berlin and are recipients of a number of national and international awards.
